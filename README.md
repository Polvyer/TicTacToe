TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a JavaFX single-player game where a player can play against the
game server in a simple game of TicTacToe. On the server side, game logs are
shown of every game in session. Multiple players can play against the server
at the same time. The server can choose whatever port to listen on, and
then wait for clients to connect. On the client side, the player chooses
what IP and port to connect to. Once connected, a player can choose the
difficulty of the server (easy, medium, or expert), and proceed to play
one round of TicTacToe with it. Every player connected to the server
can see the most # of wins leaderboard. This updates regularly.
